# Loan Repayment & Customer Behavior Analysis in FinTech
This project investigates borrower behavior and repayment patterns using a structured FinTech loan dataset. The goal is to understand how customer demographics, loan characteristics, and behavioral attributes influence repayment outcomes.

The notebook walks through the essential steps of the data analysis lifecycle, including data loading, cleaning, wrangling, and visualization. Date inconsistencies were treated, missing entries were handled appropriately, and variables were transformed where necessary to enhance interpretability.

The exploratory data analysis highlights trends in loan performance, repayment timelines, default tendencies, and customer attributes. Visualizations provide a clearer look at how factors such as loan amount, loan term, and customer income relate to repayment behavior.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of data cleaning and exploratory analysis within a FinTech context, offering insights that can help financial institutions design better credit strategies.

The repository is suitable for learners, analysts, and professionals interested in applied financial analytics.
